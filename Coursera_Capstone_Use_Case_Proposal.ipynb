According to the FAA, as of June 2019, a staggering 2,781,971 passengers fly daily in the US. Passengers generally perceive flying as safe, given the rigorous inspections and security measures in place to prevent and address potential incidents. Nevertheless, there remains a slim possibility of unfortunate occurrences.\n","\n","Consider being tasked with a project by a leading airline. Your objective is to develop machine learning models that can forecast and categorize the severity of airplane accidents based on historical incidents. By accomplishing this, all airlines, and indeed the entire aviation industry, would be able to foresee the potential severity of airplane accidents caused by various factors and subsequently formulate action plans to minimize associated risks.\n","\n","### Data:\n","The dataset consists of two files, both shared in the same folder:\n","\n","●\tTrain.csv: [10000 x 12 excluding the headers] contains Training data\n","\n","●\tTest.csv: [2500 x 11 excluding the headers] contains Test data\n","\n","#### Columns\tDescription\n","Accident_ID\tunique id assigned to each row\n","\n","Accident_Type_Code\tthe type of accident (factor, not numeric)\n","\n","Cabin_Temperature\tthe last recorded temperature before the incident, measured in degrees Fahrenheit\n","\n","Turbulence_In_gforces\tthe recorded/estimated turbulence experienced during the accident\n","\n","Control_Metric\tan estimation of how much control the pilot had during the incident given the factors at play\n","\n","Total_Safety_Complaints\tnumber of complaints from mechanics prior to the accident\n","\n","Days_Since_Inspection\thow long the plane went without inspection before the incident\n","\n","Safety_Score\ta measure of how safe the plane was deemed to be\n","\n","Violations\tnumber of violations that the aircraft received during inspections\n","\n","Severity\ta description (4 level factor) on the severity of the crash [Target]"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":470387,"sourceId":881902,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30014,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":false,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
