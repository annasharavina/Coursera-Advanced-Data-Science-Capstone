observed\n","a.\tSafety score is normally distributed  and has few outliers\n","b.\tControl_Metric is skewed to the left but normally distributed with outliers\n","c.\tTurbulence_In_gForce is skewed to the left but normally distributed with outliers\n","d.\tCabin_Temprature is skewed to the right but normally distributed with outliers\n","e.\tMax_Elevation is t normally distributed with

were removed as they were considered outliers\n","10.\tLabel Encoding was performed on the Target Column\n","11.\tBasic Feature Engineering was performed in the interest of time and lack of domain expertise to create new features\n","12.\tIndependent features and Target columns were split as X and Y\n","13.\tK-Fold cross-validation was performed to create multiple folds of  train and validation data\n","14.\t2 Models were taken into consideration based on the data\n","a.\tGradient Boosting\n","b.\tXG Boost\n","15.\tXGBoost was considered as final model and RandomSearchCV was used for
